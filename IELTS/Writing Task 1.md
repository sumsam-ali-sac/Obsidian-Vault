**Question:**  
The line graph below shows the percentage of households with internet access in three countries (the UK, the USA, and Canada) between 2000 and 2020.

---

### **Band 9 Sample Answer:**

The line graph illustrates the proportion of households in the UK, the USA, and Canada that had access to the Internet from 2000 to 2020.

**Overall**, internet penetration increased dramatically in all three nations over the period, with Canada maintaining the highest access rate throughout, while the UK experienced the most rapid growth.

In 2000, only about **20%** of British households had internet access, compared to around **30%** in the USA and **40%** in Canada. By 2010, these figures had risen sharply, reaching roughly **65%**, **70%**, and **80%** respectively.

By 2020, almost all households in Canada were connected (**98%**), followed closely by the USA (**95%**) and the UK (**92%**). Notably, the gap among the three countries narrowed considerably by the end of the period.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Map**

**Question:**  
The maps below show the layout of a seaside village in 1990 and 2020.

---

### **Band 9 Sample Answer:**

The two maps illustrate how a seaside village transformed between 1990 and 2020.

**Overall**, the area became far more developed and urbanized over the 30-year period, with new residential areas and leisure facilities replacing much of the farmland and open space.

In 1990, the village was relatively small, consisting mainly of a few houses near the coast, a hotel, and surrounding farmland. By 2020, the farmland had been **replaced by modern housing**, and **a new road network** was built connecting different parts of the village.

Additionally, **a marina was constructed** along the coast, and **several shops and a restaurant** appeared near the hotel. The **forest area to the north** remained largely unchanged.

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Process Diagram**

**Question:**  
The diagram below shows the process of producing electricity from geothermal energy.

---

### **Band 9 Sample Answer:**

The diagram illustrates how electricity is produced using geothermal energy.

**Overall**, the process involves five main stages, beginning with the collection of cold water and ending with the generation of electricity in a power plant.

Initially, **cold water is pumped down** through an injection well into a **geothermal zone** located deep underground. There, the water passes through **hot rocks**, becoming **heated by geothermal energy**.

The resulting **hot water** is then pumped up through a **production well** into a **condenser**, where it is converted into **steam**. This steam **spins a turbine**, which in turn **drives a generator**, ultimately producing electricity.
