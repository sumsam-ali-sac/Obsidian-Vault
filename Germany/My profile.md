Engineered a cross-modal AI framework to detect and semantically align olfactory references across multilingual historical texts and artworks spanning the 16th–20th centuries. Integrated CLIP embeddings for semantic text-image alignment, enabling the system to understand conceptual relationships between textual descriptions and visual representations. Combined YOLOv8 object detection with Mistral LLM-based contextual reasoning to identify smell sources within images and associate these with historical linguistic references. Achieved 75.29% accuracy and a 0.45 F1-score, demonstrating performance superiority over traditional sequential models (RNN, LSTM) for this cross-modal task. The system established foundational methodology for sensory-aware machine learning, bridging linguistic, visual, and cultural dimensions to transform digital humanities and heritage interpretation through AI. This research demonstrates capability in multimodal learning, domain-specific NLP, and novel applications of contemporary AI methodologies.
