**1) Why obtain an MSc & career perspectives**  
I seek structured, advanced training that turns my hands-on generative-AI experience into rigorous, production-ready expertise: graduate coursework in machine learning, deep learning and scalable data systems plus supervised, lab-based projects will close the gap between prototypes and deployable systems. I aim for senior applied-research or engineering roles leading end-to-end AI solutions, and the program’s thesis pathways and campus collaborations offer direct routes to industry partnerships or a funded PhD if I pursue research leadership.

**2) Which program do you favour & why**  
I favour the Data Science & AI MSc because its concentrated curriculum in machine learning, deep learning, statistical modeling and NLP is explicitly designed for applied AI work, and its teaching is integrated with Saarbrücken’s research institutes. This alignment enables immediate thesis collaborations with campus groups, access to lab infrastructure and problem statements rooted in real research, and structured electives that let me deepen robustness, retrieval, and evaluation methods—exactly the competencies I need to scale AI from experiments to production.

**3) Why Saarbrücken & specific research interests**  
Saarbrücken’s Informatics Campus uniquely co-locates top research centers (MPI, DFKI, CISPA and an ELLIS unit), creating a dense ecosystem for language technology, retrieval, and applied machine-learning research; proximity to these groups makes collaborative, cross-institutional theses and project supervision routine. I plan to work with language-technology and applied-ML teams on retrieval-augmented systems, robustness and safety-aware deployment of large models, leveraging campus labs for reproducible experiments and industry-connected evaluation to ensure real-world impact.
